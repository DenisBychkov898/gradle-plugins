# assemble-needed

Works just like `buildNeeded`, but only invoking `assemble`.

## Setup

Add this library to the classpath:

```
buildscript {
	dependencies {
	    ...
		classpath 'com.github.rmee:assemble-needed:<VERSION>'
	}
}
```

## Tasks

`assembleNeed` to assemble the project itself and all its project dependencies.
